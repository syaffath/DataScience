# DataScience
This data science project contains data analysis from various public data sets.

# Project 1 - Heart Failure Prediction (HFP)
- heartfail.csv contains data sets, obtained through kaggle.com, it is a free open source data.
- HFP_DataVisualization.ipynb is a python data visualization file code. This code is intended to analize by visualizing all the data using standard data visualization python library such as pandas, seaborn, etc.
- HFP_DataModeling.ipynb is a python data modeling file code. This code can predict heart failure based on 6 features using machine learning classifier models such as logistic refression, SVC, nearest neighbors, and rendom forest. 
- HFP_DeepLearning.ipbnb is a python data modeling file code. This code can predict heart failure based on 6 features using deep learning model (e.g. Neural Network).
